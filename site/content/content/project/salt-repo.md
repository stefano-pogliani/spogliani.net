My current salt states are in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stefano-pogliani/salt-states).
This is my first attempt to salt states and the organisation
is a bit confsed and all over the place.


A new repo and stracture is needed to accomodate for [SPM](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/spm/)
and an improved use of the [`extend`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/extend.html).
