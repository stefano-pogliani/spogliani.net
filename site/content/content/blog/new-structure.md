Hello everyone,
after much nothingness I have decided to rewrite my website from scratch.


A new restyle
=============
The last time I did this was a little over a year ago and every time I do it I feel that it improves the site drastically:
at each rewrite the site gets simpler and the theme slicker so that navigation becomes easy and pleasant.

This time I also changed the technologies used to build the site.
For more information about these technologies check out the site's repo:
https://github.com/stefano-pogliani/spogliani.net


Main changes
============
While the changes to the style are obvious if you have seen the previous version and irrelevant if you have not, there are two major aspects of the site that changed: the navigation system and the blog integration.

Navigation
----------
The navigation system divides the site into two major areas: one for content and the other for support pages or any other information that revolves around the content but does not classify as such.

The two sections have separate buttons at the top, each leading to the sectionâ€™s index.
In the index you will find a list of pages available in that section and a brief description of what the page topic is.
Also, each page in the index is reachable directly from the drop down menu attached to the section buttons.

The content can be reached through the drop down menu on the left and the first thing there is the blog.
In addition to the blog, the content area contains my projects which are, and always will be, the main point of this site.
This time the projects are arranged by their current status.

  * Projects currently being developed or at least still supported are in the projects section and are labelled so you can immediately tell if they are active or not.
  * Projects that are no longer being developed nor supported are in the project graveyard .
    Dead projects could be resurrected if there is enough request for it but in general they would not end up in there if there was an interest to begin with.
    The site & me section is structured similarly to the content one but the index will guide you to support pages.

Blog
----
The blog is the other major change.
Over the past year or two I wanted to update the content of my site but was unable to due to luck of time (a full project takes tons of it).

The introduction of a blog aims at dealing with this issue.
Now, instead of waiting for a project to be finished I can add content more often and optionally preview full projects.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  A warning though: keeping a blog up to date is a great challenge too, one that would not leave much time to code.
  For this reason updates may not be frequent and will not be regular.
  Sorry.
