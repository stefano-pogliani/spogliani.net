My desire to write this web site with Ember.js but still have it indexed
by search engines lead to this project.
The result is a tool that uses [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) to take snapshots
(hence the name PhantomSnap) of JavaScript generated web sites or applications.

The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/stefano-pogliani/phantom-snap)
where the readme will guide you though the basics and there will also be a
blog post on the topic of crawling JavaScript soon.

When using PhantomSnap please keep in mind the limitations highlighted in the readme
and report as many issues as possible through GitHub so I can improve the tool.
