    <p>Hi there! And welcome to my web site.</p>
    <p>
      Over time I started several projects, most of which are 
      not actively developed after the challenge that made them
      interesting is solved or after they are stable enough
      for me to use.

      This web site was born to collect those projects that make
      it past the initial interest and become worthy of
      publication.
      And now, at its fourth full rewrite every time with
      different structure and techniques, this site has become
      one of those project itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But developing and maintaining any project is time
      consuming and I never have much time to share my projects,
      ideas or most importantly knowledge.

      In the hope to change at least the last part I integrated
      a blog into the site and will try to fill it up with
      interesting or amusing technical knowledge and facts
      (but no promises).
