<div class="page-header">
What information about me is collected?
=======================================
</div>
The short answer is **Nothing**!

This site used to use Piwik to collect detailed visitor information,
which **was removed** during my migration to AWS S3 static hosting.

While I do not collect any data, and S3 access logging is disabled,
I cannot guarantee that Amazon does not still collect you visits.
