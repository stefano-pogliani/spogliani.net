I feel a little embarrassed by how late I have started this list
but here it is anyway.
Hopefully I will be able to fill this list with interesting
things and relatively fast.


<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr><th colspan=2>Bug fixes</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="https://github.com/KuiKui/Octosplit">
          Octosplit
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Chrome extension that provides side by side diffs in GitHub
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
