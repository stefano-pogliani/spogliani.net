    <p>
      As these are my first years after college I am overwhelmed
      with things to learn and skills to improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      One very interesting and efficient way to learn I found is to
      attempt to solve a problem on my own but using one or more
      existing solutions as a reference and source of ideas to see
      how others have solved the same problem and what I can come
      up with.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason I have been doing my best to open source my
      projects after they are "ready to go".
      Unfortunately not may get to that point so my GitHub profile
      feels really empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it's not a big deal, I will have to fill it up :-)
